# OLD DATA
These are other datasets that could also be used for the model, however it was determined that the home iot device data was to be used for the project. ESC-50 contains general purpose audio training and testing data. The MIVIA folder contains audio data created by a roman research team to train audio surveillence machine learning models to detect screams, gunshots, and glass shatterings and contains training and testing data for those kinds of audio events. The MIVIA folder also contains a script that will convert the metadata into a csv file so it can be used by the scripts used in this project.
